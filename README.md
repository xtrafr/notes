Your primary data stays in a highly-optimized library inside your browser's local storage. On top of that, your note seamlessly syncs into the URL Hash using standard base64 compression. This means:

- **Library context** - The app tracks what note you are editing instantly
- **Share notes** - Just copy the URL to hand someone an active clone
- **No database** - Fast and completely private
- **Offline first** - PWA capability included

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+
- **Storage**: URL Hash + LocalStorage
- **PWA**: Service Worker + Web App Manifest
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
